# Fishark-Game--Reliazed-in-one-night-
The game contains 2 levels of playing for a fish and a shark.

This is a game with two levels. 
There are other fish that swim out of the school after a while, if it swims up to them (there are three types of such fish - common; 
it changes color, depending on the shark, and a fish that swims out of the school after a while). 
If the main fish is in the school, then if the shark catches up, at the beginning it eats other fish (that is, they go as protection).
The second level - the main character is a shark. She must reach the finish line. 
She has lives, which she replenishes when she eats fish (fish, when approaching, sharks must swim to algae, hide), 
there is another shark that can also eat these fish, so the main shark must frighten off by swimming close to her. 
The game ends when the shark swims to the finish line or when lives run out, that is, has not eaten enough fish.
